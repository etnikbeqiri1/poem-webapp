# POEM Frontend

**POEM** is an online postal management solution for Kosovo's newly created quick postal services that works with Gjirafa as their major partnership as well as individual sellers using Facebook advertisements, allowing their customers to add product management stock and place orders to distribute to various clients. The frontend is built using React JS and Material UI, while the backend is serverless and works closely with Firebase to store user data and photographs. The primary backend service is developed in PHP Laravel Lumen and runs on Google Cloud Run via a Docker container. Other features will be built with Node.js to round out the serverless architecture.
